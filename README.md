A quick exercise in understanding classes, pointers, references, function references, etc.

ClassInC:
    created a basic animal class with a function to print animal name

StackClass:
    Done DYNAMICALLY. can change size and is NOT optimised for indexed access.
    Push, pop, peek functions are working. Stack nodes are fully freed via recursion
    As with higher level languages, memory for objects of the 'class' is on heap
    Abstracted stack nodes from what is accessible via the header file.
